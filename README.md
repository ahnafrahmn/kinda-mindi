# Observation Jotting – Ahmed

When Ahmed first joined the centre, he appeared shy and uncomfortable in the new environment. He often cried during drop-off and found it difficult to settle into the group. He was hesitant to interact with educators and preferred to stay alone. It was clear that he needed time and support to feel safe and secure in his new surroundings.

Over time, with gentle encouragement and consistent support from educators, Ahmed started to feel more comfortable. We noticed that he slowly began to explore the room and observe other children at play. He responded well to calm and caring voices, and his crying gradually reduced. Now, Ahmed has become more confident and settled.

Currently, Ahmed enjoys playing with his peers and takes part in group activities with excitement. He especially loves playing in the tunnel with his friends. He crawls through it with joy and often laughs and smiles while doing so. He also enjoys playing with toy cars, pushing them along the mat and sharing them with his peers. Ahmed shows good social development as he takes turns and shows interest in what others are doing.

Another favourite activity for Ahmed is playing with the sand and pretend pets in the outdoor area. He uses small tools to dig in the sand and places the toy pets inside, pretending to care for them. He often talks to his friends during this play and shows imagination in his actions.

It is pleasing to see how much Ahmed has grown since he started. He now shows a strong sense of belonging and enjoys being part of the group. His social skills are developing well, and he is building positive relationships with both educators and peers.

We will continue to support Ahmed’s confidence and encourage him to express his feelings and ideas during play. His progress is a wonderful reminder of how children can flourish with care, patience, and a safe environment.

# Observation Report – Focus Child: Ratu

Ratu is a bright and curious child who has recently shown improvement in his concentration and focus during playtime. In the past, Ratu often moved quickly from one activity to another and found it difficult to stay with one task for a long period. However, over the past few weeks, there has been a noticeable change in his behaviour.

Yesterday, Ratu showed great interest in playing with a ball. He spent a long time kicking, throwing, and catching it with his friends. He seemed to really enjoy the activity and stayed focused without getting distracted. After that, he went to the sandpit area, where he used different tools and containers to dig, fill, and pour sand. He worked on his own little track in the sand, which kept him busy for a good amount of time.

Later in the day, Ratu joined the construction area and played with Lego blocks. He tried to build something by stacking the blocks in different ways. Although he needed some support, he showed patience and problem-solving skills. He didn’t give up easily and was proud of what he built.

It is very encouraging to see Ratu’s improvement in concentration. He is beginning to stay with activities longer and seems more engaged in his play. He is also developing his fine motor skills and creativity through hands-on experiences. Ratu is learning to work independently as well as with peers.

We will continue to support Ratu by offering interesting and age-appropriate activities that encourage focus and involvement. With continued guidance and encouragement, we believe Ratu will keep making progress in his learning and development.

Observation Report – Social Development of Amelia

Over the past few weeks, I have been observing Amelia’s behavior and social interactions during playtime and group activities. I am pleased to note a positive change in her social development.

At the beginning of my observation, Amelia appeared to be more reserved. She preferred to play alone and did not often engage with other children. She seemed to enjoy individual activities such as drawing or playing with puzzles by herself. Although she was always polite and well-behaved, she kept a certain distance from her peers.

Recently, however, I have noticed a significant improvement. Amelia has started showing interest in group play. She now joins in activities such as building blocks, pretend play, and outdoor games with other children. She is also beginning to initiate conversations and share toys willingly. This shows that she is developing trust and building friendships.

During one session, I observed Amelia playing “house” with two other girls. She took turns, shared roles, and even comforted another child who seemed upset. Her facial expressions and body language reflected happiness and a sense of belonging. She smiled, made eye contact, and responded positively to her peers.

It is clear that Amelia is gaining confidence in her social skills. She is learning how to communicate, share, and work cooperatively with others. These are important milestones in early childhood development.

Overall, I am very pleased with Amelia’s progress. With continued support and encouragement, I believe she will continue to grow socially and emotionally. Her newfound interest in group play is a wonderful sign of her developing social awareness and readiness to build strong relationships with others.

# Daily Journal – 11th April 2025

Today began with the warmth of a bright, sparkling sun, even though the winter chill was in the air. The children were very happy to enjoy the sunny weather. They had a wonderful time playing and learning together outdoors.

Our group time was held in the cosy cabby house. The children sat together and enjoyed painting activities. They used different colours to paint the sunny weather and beautiful nature around them. It was lovely to see their creativity and excitement as they expressed their ideas through art.

After painting, the children sat down for a healthy morning tea. They enjoyed fresh fruits and jam bread, which gave them lots of energy for the rest of the day.

One of their favourite places to explore is the kitchen corner. Today, many of the children enjoyed pretending to cook. They had the chance to cut play vegetables and cook pretend meals. They acted just like their parents, serving food to the teachers and their friends. This role-play activity helped build their confidence and social skills.

Some of the toddlers also had fun playing with dinosaur toys. They made dinosaur sounds and moved around like dinosaurs, which was a fun and energetic activity that sparked their imagination.

For lunch, the children sat with their little friends and enjoyed a warm, yummy meal together. After lunch, they had their regular midday nap. Rest time helped them relax and recharge.

When they woke up, the children were full of energy and ready to enjoy some outdoor play. They ran, climbed, and explored the outdoor area with big smiles on their faces.

It was a joyful and engaging day for all our toddlers. We loved seeing them grow in confidence, explore their creativity, and enjoy their time with friends.

# Daily Journal: Observing Toddlers’ Growth and Development

Today was a busy and exciting day with the little ones. Children aged 2 to 3 years are full of energy, curiosity, and emotions, making every moment a learning experience.

In the morning, the toddlers explored different toys and activities. Some were interested in stacking blocks, while others enjoyed playing with soft toys. One child tried to build a tall tower but got frustrated when it fell. With some encouragement, they tried again and succeeded, showing perseverance and problem-solving skills.

During snack time, I observed their growing independence. Some children needed help opening their lunchboxes, while others confidently ate by themselves. One child, who usually prefers to be fed, attempted to use a spoon today. It was a small but significant step in developing self-help skills.

Later, we had a fun music and movement session. The children danced, clapped, and followed simple actions to songs. This activity helped improve their coordination and listening skills. One little boy, who was initially shy, started dancing with a big smile, enjoying the moment.

In the afternoon, we had outdoor playtime. The children ran around, climbed, and played with balls. They are still learning to take turns, so there were a few disagreements, but with gentle guidance, they started sharing and playing together.

Overall, today was filled with new experiences and small achievements. At this age, children are learning through play, exploration, and interaction. Watching them grow and develop is truly rewarding.

# Daily Journal: Observing Children’s Growth and Development

Today was another wonderful day spent with children, full of curiosity, learning, and laughter. Each child brings a unique personality and energy that makes every moment special.

In the morning, I observed how children interact with their peers. Some were eager to make friends, while others took time to warm up. One child, who was usually shy, surprised me by confidently joining a group activity. It was heartwarming to see their progress in social skills.

During playtime, the children displayed creativity and problem-solving skills. They built towers with blocks, designed pretend houses, and worked together to complete puzzles. Their teamwork and willingness to help each other showed the importance of collaboration from an early age.

Lunchtime was another opportunity to observe their independence. Some children needed reminders to wash their hands and eat properly, while others demonstrated excellent self-care habits. Encouraging good manners and hygiene is essential for their development.

In the afternoon, we engaged in a storytelling session. The children listened attentively and asked thoughtful questions. This activity not only improved their language skills but also sparked their imagination. One child even created their own story and shared it with the group.

Overall, today was filled with small but meaningful moments of growth. Each child is learning at their own pace, and it’s a privilege to guide them through their journey. I look forward to seeing how they continue to develop and explore the world around them.
