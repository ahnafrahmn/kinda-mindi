#Daily Journal – 11th April 2025

Today began with the warmth of a bright, sparkling sun, even though the winter chill was in the air. The children were very happy to enjoy the sunny weather. They had a wonderful time playing and learning together outdoors.

Our group time was held in the cosy cabby house. The children sat together and enjoyed painting activities. They used different colours to paint the sunny weather and beautiful nature around them. It was lovely to see their creativity and excitement as they expressed their ideas through art.

After painting, the children sat down for a healthy morning tea. They enjoyed fresh fruits and jam bread, which gave them lots of energy for the rest of the day.

One of their favourite places to explore is the kitchen corner. Today, many of the children enjoyed pretending to cook. They had the chance to cut play vegetables and cook pretend meals. They acted just like their parents, serving food to the teachers and their friends. This role-play activity helped build their confidence and social skills.

Some of the toddlers also had fun playing with dinosaur toys. They made dinosaur sounds and moved around like dinosaurs, which was a fun and energetic activity that sparked their imagination.

For lunch, the children sat with their little friends and enjoyed a warm, yummy meal together. After lunch, they had their regular midday nap. Rest time helped them relax and recharge.

When they woke up, the children were full of energy and ready to enjoy some outdoor play. They ran, climbed, and explored the outdoor area with big smiles on their faces.

It was a joyful and engaging day for all our toddlers. We loved seeing them grow in confidence, explore their creativity, and enjoy their time with friends.

# Daily Journal: Observing Toddlers’ Growth and Development

Today was a busy and exciting day with the little ones. Children aged 2 to 3 years are full of energy, curiosity, and emotions, making every moment a learning experience.

In the morning, the toddlers explored different toys and activities. Some were interested in stacking blocks, while others enjoyed playing with soft toys. One child tried to build a tall tower but got frustrated when it fell. With some encouragement, they tried again and succeeded, showing perseverance and problem-solving skills.

During snack time, I observed their growing independence. Some children needed help opening their lunchboxes, while others confidently ate by themselves. One child, who usually prefers to be fed, attempted to use a spoon today. It was a small but significant step in developing self-help skills.

Later, we had a fun music and movement session. The children danced, clapped, and followed simple actions to songs. This activity helped improve their coordination and listening skills. One little boy, who was initially shy, started dancing with a big smile, enjoying the moment.

In the afternoon, we had outdoor playtime. The children ran around, climbed, and played with balls. They are still learning to take turns, so there were a few disagreements, but with gentle guidance, they started sharing and playing together.

Overall, today was filled with new experiences and small achievements. At this age, children are learning through play, exploration, and interaction. Watching them grow and develop is truly rewarding.

# Daily Journal: Observing Children’s Growth and Development

Today was another wonderful day spent with children, full of curiosity, learning, and laughter. Each child brings a unique personality and energy that makes every moment special.

In the morning, I observed how children interact with their peers. Some were eager to make friends, while others took time to warm up. One child, who was usually shy, surprised me by confidently joining a group activity. It was heartwarming to see their progress in social skills.

During playtime, the children displayed creativity and problem-solving skills. They built towers with blocks, designed pretend houses, and worked together to complete puzzles. Their teamwork and willingness to help each other showed the importance of collaboration from an early age.

Lunchtime was another opportunity to observe their independence. Some children needed reminders to wash their hands and eat properly, while others demonstrated excellent self-care habits. Encouraging good manners and hygiene is essential for their development.

In the afternoon, we engaged in a storytelling session. The children listened attentively and asked thoughtful questions. This activity not only improved their language skills but also sparked their imagination. One child even created their own story and shared it with the group.

Overall, today was filled with small but meaningful moments of growth. Each child is learning at their own pace, and it’s a privilege to guide them through their journey. I look forward to seeing how they continue to develop and explore the world around them.
